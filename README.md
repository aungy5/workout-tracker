  ## Description
  In this project we were asked to create a workout tracker to help users reach their fitness goals. The idea here is that if users can track their workouts over time, they are more likely to reach their fitness goals. We had to use mongoDB and mongoose to store data points from each workout, and then we had to utilize express to handle the routing within the application. 
  ## Installation
